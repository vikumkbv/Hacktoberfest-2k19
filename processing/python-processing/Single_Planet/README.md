# Single Planet / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj--Mc-c2JU)

This is a simple process to create a low-detail planet with Python Processing. The general workflow is to draw a circle for the base planet, draw a series of rings on top of it, then cover a portion of the rings with a filled in arc to create the illusion that the rings actually circle the planet.

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](processing.org). Feel free to reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
